                <p class="description">
                    The Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK developed the credit-card-sized single-board computer. Originally aimed at promoting computer science education in schools and impoverished nations, it has now become a global phenomenon enjoyed by hobbyists, educators, and professionals.
                </p>
                <p>This platform is capable of running a full Linux operating system, supporting Python, Scratch, and C++, as well as handling multimedia, web browsing, and IoT applications seamlessly. Its price (beginning as a few hundred rupees) and community support make it an excellent choice for learners and makers globally.</p>
                <p>Raspberry Pi enables people to turn concepts into reality without having a great deal of technical know-how or substantial financial resources, from straightforward LED projects to intricate robotics and home automation systems.
